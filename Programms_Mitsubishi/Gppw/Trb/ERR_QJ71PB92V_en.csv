F110,"Although Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON, the BBLKRD instruction is not executed.",Modify the sequence program so that the BBLKRD instruction is executed when Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON.
F111,"Although Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON, the BBLKWR instruction is not executed.",Modify the sequence program so that the BBLKWR instruction is executed when Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON.
F112,"Although Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON, the BBLKRD and BBLKWR instructions are not executed.",Modify the sequence program so that the BBLKRD and BBLKWR instructions are executed when Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) is ON.
F113,Data consistency start request signal (Y0C) was turned ON during execution of the data consistency function in automatic refresh.,"The data consistency function in automatic refresh and dedicated instructions are not concurrently executable.  In the master parameter setting of GX Configurator-DP, disable the data consistency function."
F120,Diagnostic information was generated on a DP-Slave.,Check Diagnostic information area for  diagnostic information generated in a DP-Slave and take corrective actions.
F121,There is a DP-Master or DP-Slave that has a duplicated FDL address on the same line.,"Check the FDL addresses of the DP-Master and DP-Slaves, and set correct parameters without duplication.When the QJ71PB92V is mounted on a redundant system, reset Switch 1 in the intelligent function module switch setting."
F122,An error has been detected on the line.,"Check the wiring status of the bus terminator(s) and PROFIBUS cable(s).If the terminating resistor and PROFIBUS cable wiring status is correct, increase the set value of the master parameter, ""Min. slave interval""."
