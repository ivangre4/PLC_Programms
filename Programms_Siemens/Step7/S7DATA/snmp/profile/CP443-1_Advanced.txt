For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
SNMPItem=_ifDescr.cp_info          |R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.5|04|  A textual string containing information about the interface. This string should include the name of the manufacturer, the product name and the version of the hardware interface.

SNMPItem=ifOutErrors.Port_1      |R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20.1|41| The number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors.

SNMPItem=sysUpTime|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0|43|The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
SNMPItem=sysServices|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0|02|A value which indicates the set of services that this entity primarily offers. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs primarily routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., IP gateways) 4 end-to-end (e.g., IP hosts) 7 applications (e.g., mail relays) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.
SNMPItem=sysObjectID|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0|06|The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
SNMPItem=sysName|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0|04|An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.
SNMPItem=sysLocation|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0|04|The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').
SNMPItem=sysDescr|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0|04|A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software. It is mandatory that this only contain printable ASCII characters.
SNMPItem=sysContact|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0|04|The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.
