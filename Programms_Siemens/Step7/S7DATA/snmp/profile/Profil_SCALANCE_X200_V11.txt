SNMPItem=icmpOutErrors|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.5.15.0|41|The number of ICMP messages which this entity did not send due to problems discovered within ICMP such as a lack of buffers. This value should not include errors discovered outside the ICMP layer such as the inability of IP to route the resultant datagram.

SNMPItem=ipReasmFails|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16.0|41|The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
SNMPItem=ipOutRequests|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10.0|41|The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission. Note that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams.
SNMPItem=ipOutNoRoutes|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12.0|41|The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
SNMPItem=ipOutDiscards|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.11.0|41|The number of output IP datagrams for which no problem was encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space).

SNMPItem=ipInReceives|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3.0|41|The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error.
SNMPItem=ipInHdrErrors|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4.0|41|The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.
SNMPItem=ipInDiscards|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8.0|41|The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.
SNMPItem=ipInDelivers|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9.0|41|The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).
SNMPItem=ipInAddrErrors|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5.0|41|The number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
SNMPItem=ipFragOKs|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17.0|41|The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
SNMPItem=ipFragFails|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18.0|41|The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.
SNMPItem=ipFragCreates|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.19.0|41|The number of IP datagram fragments that have been generated as a result of fragmentation at this entity.
SNMPItem=ipForwarding|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.1.0|02|The indication of whether this entity is acting as an IP gateway in respect to the forwarding of datagrams received by, but not addressed to, this entity. IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
SNMPItem=ipForwDatagrams|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6.0|41|The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
SNMPItem=ipDefaultTTL|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2.0|02|The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

[System]
SNMPItem=sysDescr|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0|04|A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software. It is mandatory that this only contain printable ASCII characters.
SNMPItem=sysObjectID|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0|06|The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
SNMPItem=sysUpTime|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0|43|The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
SNMPItem=sysContact|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0|04|The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.
SNMPItem=sysName|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0|04|An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.
SNMPItem=sysLocation|RW|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0|04|The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').
SNMPItem=sysServices|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0|02|A value which indicates the set of services that this entity primarily offers. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs primarily routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., IP gateways) 4 end-to-end (e.g., IP hosts) 7 applications (e.g., mail relays) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

SNMPItem=tcpRtoMax|R|.1.3.6.1.2.1.6.3.0|02|The maximum value permitted by a TCP implementation for the retransmission timeout, measured in milliseconds.
